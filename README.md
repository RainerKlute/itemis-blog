The project team has worked hard since the [Eclipse GEF 5.0.0 release](https://blogs.itemis.com/en/graphical-editing-framework-gef-5.0.0-release) two years ago. The new release fixes [issues](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.gef/releases/5.1.0-2019-06/bugs) on the `GEF MVC`, `GEF Zest` and `GEF DOT` components.

We would like to thank all the contributors that make this release possible:
